# Intro, Set up, Analysis

* **Spark**: A unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
* **Set up**:  `sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", version = "2.3")`
* **Analysis**: `sparklyr` integrates with many R like `dplyr`, `magrittr`, `broom`, `DBI`, `tibble`, `rlang`, and many others

<br>

* However, you cannot use the standard R models. Spark has a large library of modeling commands `MLlib`.

# Major Trends in Cluster Computing


.large[
* **On-premises**  
  * on-premises clusters represent a set of computing instances procured and managed by staff members from your organization

* **Cloud**  
  * starting with a cloud cluster can be quite convenient since it will allow you to access a proper cluster in a matter of minutes.
  
* **Kubernetes**  
  * open source container orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications

* **Tools**  
  * improve monitoring, SQL analysis, workflow coordination, and more

# On-premises ("on-prem") clusters

.large[
* **PRO**: highly customized and controlled
* **CON**: incur higher initial expenses and maintenance costs.
]

When using on-premises Spark clusters, there are two concepts you should consider:

**Cluster manager**: allows multiple applications to be run in the same cluster
To run Spark within a computing cluster, you will need to run software capable of initializing Spark over each physical machine and register all the available computing nodes. This software is known as a cluster manager. 
  * **Standalone**: Allows you to use Spark without installing additional software in your cluster.
  * **Yarn**: the resource manager of the Hadoop project
  * **Mesos**: an open source project to manage computer cluster

# Standalone Cluster Manager Example
In Spark Standalone, Spark uses itself as its own cluster manager, which allows you to use Spark without installing additional software in your cluster

## Standalone Cluster Manager
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# Retrieve the Spark installation directory

spark_home <- spark_home_dir()

# Build paths and classes
spark_path <- file.path(spark_home, "bin", "spark-class")

# Start cluster manager master node
system2(spark_path, "org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master", wait = FALSE)

# Start worker node, find master URL at http://localhost:8080/
system2(spark_path, c("org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker",
                      "spark://192.168.0.31:7077"), wait = FALSE)

# http://localhost:8080/
```

# Distributions

**Spark distribution**: The support and enhancements to Apache Spark by companies providing additional management software, services, and resources to help manage applications in their cluster.
  * Cloudera
  * Hortonworks
  * MapR

---

# Cloud Clusters
.large[
**PRO**: Allows access to a proper cluster in a matter of minutes
**CON**: Requires knowledge and access to cloud providers (Amazon (AWS), Microsoft (Azure), Google (GCP)...)
]
* [Amazon (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/): 
  * provides an on-demand Spark cluster through [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc).
* [Google](https://cloud.google.com/)
  * [Google Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc) as a cloud-based managed Spark and Hadoop service offered on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
* [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
  *  [Azure HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/hdinsight/) service provides support for on-demand Spark clusters

# Cloud Cluster Example
In Spark Standalone, Spark uses itself as its own cluster manager, which allows you to use Spark without installing additional software in your cluster

## Cloud Example: AWS
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
aws emr create-cluster --applications Name=Hadoop Name=Spark Name=Hive \
  --release-label emr-5.8.0 --service-role EMR_DefaultRole --instance-groups \
  InstanceGroupType=MASTER,InstanceCount=1,InstanceType=m3.2xlarge \
  InstanceGroupType=CORE,InstanceCount=2,InstanceType=m3.2xlarge \ 
  --bootstrap-action Path=s3://aws-bigdata-blog/artifacts/aws-blog-emr-\
rstudio-sparklyr/rstudio_sparklyr_emr5.sh,Args=["--user-pw", "<password>", \
  "--rstudio", "--arrow"] --ec2-attributes InstanceProfile=EMR_EC2_DefaultRole
```

# Kubernetes
.large[
* **PRO**: open source container orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications
* **CON**: Complex configuration and orchestration
]
  * Kubernetes is supported across all major cloud providers - launch, manage, and tear down Kubernetes clusters
  * You can deploy Spark over any Kubernetes cluster, and you can use R to connect, analyze, model, and more
  

---

# Tools
.large[
Improve monitoring, SQL analysis, workflow coordination, and more
]
  * **RStudio Server**: run RStudio as a web service within a Spark cluster.


* **RStudio Server**:  WIP
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

```

# Connections
The overall connection architecture for a Spark cluster is composed of three types of compute instances: the driver node, the worker nodes, and the cluster manager
.large[
* **Driver node**  
  * delegating work to the worker nodes, but also with aggregating their results and controlling computation flow

* **Worker nodes**  
  * execute compute tasks over partitioned data and communicate intermediate results to other workers or back to the driver node.
  
* **Cluster manager**  
  * allows Spark to be executed in the cluster;
]

---

# Edge Nodes

.large[
* Computing clusters are configured to enable high bandwidth and fast network connectivity between nodes. 
* To optimize network connectivity, the nodes in the cluster are configured to trust one another and to disable security features
]

**Two connection methods**:
  * **Terminal**: establish a remote connection into the cluster; after you connect into the cluster, you can launch R and then use sparklyr.
    * **PRO**: Uses terminal and Secure Shell - used only while configuring the cluster or troubleshooting issues.
    * **CON**: terminal can be cumbersome for some tasks, like exploratory data analysis
    
  * **Web Browser**: Install a web server in an edge node that provides access to run R with sparklyr from a web browser.
    * **PRO**: "Usually more productive to install a web server in an edge node..."
    * **CON**: terminal can be cumbersome for some tasks, like exploratory data analysis

# Connecting to Spark's edge node
![](https://therinspark.com/the-r-in-spark_files/figure-html/connections-spark-edge-1.png)
---

# Spark Home

.large[
* After you connect to an edge node, the next step is to determine where Spark is installed, a location known as the SPARK_HOME 
* if this code returns an empty string, this would mean that the SPARK_HOME environment variable is not set in your cluster, so you will need to specify SPARK_HOME while using spark_connect(), as follows:
]

## Spark Home example
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(sparklyr)
Sys.getenv("SPARK_HOME")
spark_home_dir()


sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", spark_home = spark_installed_versions()$dir)
# spark_uninstall(version = "2.3.3", hadoop_version = "2.7")
# spark_uninstall(version = "2.4.3", hadoop_version = "2.7")

```


---
# Local Connection
.large[
* Spark starts a single process that runs most of the cluster components like the Spark context and a single executor 
* This is ideal to learn Spark, work offline, troubleshoot issues, or test code before you run it over a large compute cluster
]

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

# Connect to local Spark instance
sc <- spark_connect(master = "local")

```

---
# Standalone
.large[
* Connecting to a Spark Standalone cluster requires the location of the cluster manager’s master instance, 
* A connection in standalone mode starts from sparklyr, which launches spark-submit
* submits the sparklyr application and creates the Spark Context, which requests executors from the Spark Standalone instance running under the given master address


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

# Connect to Spark Standalone connection

sc <- spark_connect(master = "spark://spark://192.168.0.31:7077")

```

![](connections-standalone-diagram-1.png)



---
# Additional Connections

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

# To connect, use master = "spark://hostname:port" in spark_connect() as follows:
library(sparklyr)
sc <- sparklyr::spark_connect(master = "spark://192.168.0.31:7077")
sc <- spark_connect(master = "yarn")
sc <- spark_connect(master = "yarn-cluster")


```


---
# Kubernetes

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(sparklyr)
sc <- spark_connect(config = spark_config_kubernetes(
  "k8s://https://<apiserver-host>:<apiserver-port>",
  account = "default",
  image = "docker.io/owner/repo:version",
  version = "2.3.1"))
```
